        <h2>Flora</h2>
      <p>The flora of Aspromonte is characterized by marked heterogeneity as a result of low latitude, proximity to the sea, and altitude gradient. Differentiation of vegetation is also found between the Tyrrhenian and Ionian slopes.</p>
      <p>At low altitudes, along the coastal strip the typical flora of the warm Lauretum subzone is established, whose typical representatives are xerophilous Mediterranean scrub (Pistacia lentiscus, Myrtus communis, Arbutus unedo, Euphorbia dendroides, Erica arborea, etc.) and, in cultivated areas, citrus and olive trees. Along the torrents, riparian vegetation is established, the most representative essences of which are Alnus glutinosa (black alder), Populus nigra (black poplar), Salix sp. (willows), Nerium oleander (oleander), Tamarix (tamarisk).</p>
      <p>In the interior and at higher elevations, thermophilic vegetation is succeeded by forest vegetation, which covers about 40000 ha. At lower altitudes, the most frequent forest species is holm oak, while from 600 meters upward deciduous and coniferous species become more frequent. On the Tyrrhenian side, chestnut trees are frequent, up to 1,000 meters above sea level, while on the Ionian side deciduous oaks prevail, represented by downy oak, downy oak and downy oak. Between 800 and 1,700 meters the Calabrian black pine or larch pine (Pinus nigra laricio) is representative, and from 1,200 meters to the highest altitudes the Fagetum extends, whose most representative essences are beech and silver fir.</p>
      <h2>Fauna</h2>
      <p>Mammals present in the park include the wolf (Canis lupus italicus), present in the central-eastern part of the massif, wild boar (Sus scrofa), the elusive wild cat (Felis silvestris), marten (Martes martes), badger (Meles meles), fox (Vulpes vulpes), marten (Martes foina), weasel (Mustela nivalis), and otter (Lutra lutra), widespread in river valleys, the dormouse (Glis glis), the driomys (Dryomys nitedula), a dormouse-like rodent found not only in Calabria but also in the Eastern Alps, and the southern black squirrel (Sciurus meridionalis), a subspecies that differs from northern populations in that its fur coloration is black instead of red or brown. At the end of 2011, 75 specimens of the italic subspecies of roe deer, a species absent from this area for about a century, were reintroduced.</p>
      <p>The avifauna is very rich with numerous species of birds of prey including the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata), almost extinct in the rest of Italy and present in the park with two pairs, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), which recently returned to nest in the park, and other more common species such as the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), buzzard (Buteo buteo) and short-toed eagle (Circaetus gallicus). Nocturnal birds of prey include the eagle owl (Bubo bubo), Europe's largest nocturnal raptor, the tawny owl (Strix aluco) and the barn owl (Tyto alba). Other birds present include the rare partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius).</p>
      <p>Reptiles present include the Hugyi's viper (Vipera aspis hugyi), a subspecies that is characterized by its gray livery traversed by a brown band arranged in a zig-zag pattern, the cervone (Elaphe quatuorlineata) and the water snake or collared grass snake (Natrix natrix), found along streams. Amphibians are represented by the spotted salamander (Salamandra salamandra), the endemic spectacled salamander (Salamandrina terdigitata ), the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata) and the tree frog (Hyla arborea). The park's waterways are also home to the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario). Finally, among the most significant species in the entomofauna, the oak cerambyx (Cerambyx cerdo), the alpine rosalia (Rosalia alpina) and the rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes nasicornis) deserve mention.</p>

      <h2>Points of interest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The small church of San Leo in Africo represents one of the few remaining Basilian remains in Aspromonte.</li>
        <li>The Sanctuary of San Nicodemo, dating from the 10th century, is located on the Limina plateau in the territory of Mammola. It is inhabited by a monk and is visited by the faithful and tourists throughout the year. The festival is held every year on the Sunday following May 12.</li>
        <li>The Grecanica Area still retains strong characters of the Magna Graecia and Byzantine civilization, mainly due to the preservation of the Greek language of Calabria, an idiom that is classified as a dialect of ancient Greek. In Bova it is possible to admire the Norman castle and the many ancient medieval churches and patrician mansions in the historic center.</li>
        <li>Gerace is the main city of art in Aspromonte and one of the most important medieval towns in Calabria. It holds important artistic and natural beauties, such as the 12th-century castle, the very ancient Cathedral (second largest in the region after the Cathedral of Reggio Calabria, whose origins predate the 10th century), the churches of San Francesco and San Giovannello, and other sites dating back to Byzantine times.</li>
        <li>Mammola, a center of art, tourism and gastronomy, boasts a very ancient history. Particular interest is aroused by the historic center, with its small houses one attached to the other, ancient churches and noble palaces. The Santa Barbara Museum Park, a place of art and cultural meeting place for numerous international artists, is worth a special visit. Renowned for its gastronomy with the "Stocco" typical of Mammola, cooked in various ways, other typical products are smoked ricotta and goat cheese, cold cuts, "pizzata" bread (corn bread) and wheat bread baked in a wood-fired oven.</li>
        <li>San Giorgio Morgeto also holds important Hellenic remains. The medieval castle, the Church of St. Francis and the Monastery of St. Dominic are important artistic testimonies.</li>
        <li>Among the Aspromontane shrines, the absolute best known and most visited is the Sanctuary of the Madonna della Montagna di Polsi (municipality of San Luca), where between the end of August and the first days of September the feast of the Madonna della Montagna is celebrated. The characteristic procession and folklore that enlivens the days of the festival are a mixture of faith, sacredness and ancient pagan customs.</li>
